These are some few guidelines to help in producing designs as we have from the screenshots:

- For screenshots 1, 3 and 5, set the scaffoldBackgroundColor and the backgroundColor of the
  appBar in the custom_theme file to CustomColor.backgroundColor. Also set the backgroundColor
  of the bottomNavigationBar to CustomColor.backgroundColor in the app file.
- For screenshots 2 and 4, set the scaffoldBackgroundColor and the backgroundColor of the
  appBar in the custom_theme file to a white color. Also set the backgroundColor of the 
  bottomNavigationBar to a white color in the app file.
- To be able to produce the five different account screens, there is the need to change the
  account screen in the list of screen widgets so as to appreciate the screenshots.
